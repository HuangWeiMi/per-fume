[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/perfume.js.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/perfume.js) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Zizzamia/perfume.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Zizzamia/perfume.js) [![NPM Downloads](http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/perfume.js.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/perfume.js)

> Perfume is a tiny JavaScript library for measuring Short/Long Script, First Meaningful Paint, TTI (Time to Interactivity), annotating them to the DevTools timeline and reporting the results to Google Analytics.


## Installing

npm (https://www.npmjs.com/package/perfume.js):

    npm install perfume.js --save


## Importing library

You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

```javascript
import Perfume from 'perfume.js';
```

Additionally, you can import the transpiled modules from `dist/es` in case you have a modular library:

```javascript
import Perfume from 'node_modules/perfume.js/dist/es/perfume';
```

Universal Module Definition

```javascript
import Perfume from 'node_modules/perfume.js/perfume.umd.js';
```


## Start measuring

#### First Meaningful Paint
Page load is a key aspect of how a user perceives the performance of your page. See Measure Performance with the [RAIL Method](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rail) for more information.

```javascript
const perfume = new Perfume();
perfume.firstPaint(); 
// ‚ö°Ô∏è Perfume.js: firstPaint 601 ms
```

#### Annotate metrics in the DevTools
Performance.mark ([User Timing API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/User_Timing_API)) is used to create an application-defined peformance entry in the browser's performance entry buffer.

```javascript
perfume.start('fibonacci');
fibonacci(400);
perfume.end('fibonacci', true); 
// ‚ö°Ô∏è Perfume.js: fibonacci 0.14 ms
```

#### Custom Logging
Save the duration and print it out when and how it best meets your needs.

```javascript
perfume.start('fibonacci');
fibonacci(400);
const duration = this.perfume.end('fibonacci');
perfume.log('Custom logging', duration); 
// ‚ö°Ô∏è Perfume.js: Custom logging 0.14 ms
```

#### Google Analytics
To enable Perfume to send your measures to Google Analytics User timing, set the option `enable:true` and a custom `category:"name"`.

```javascript
const perfume = new Perfume();
perfume.googleAnalytics.enable = true;
perfume.googleAnalytics.category = "userId";
```
